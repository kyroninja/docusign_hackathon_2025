## ðŸ“Œ *About the Project*

### *Inspiration*
The project was inspired by the growing need for the everyday person to avoid the agreement trap. Often documents are long and have lots of legal jargon making hard to understand what one is getting into. So the solution allows one to see documents sent to the user, analysis by AI and then a decision can be taken based on the AI summary and recommendations

### *Key Features*
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind.
- OpenAI Integration: Analyze documents with ChatGPT before signing

### **What We Learned**
- How to integrate and maximize the DocuSign API.
- Effective teamwork and time management during a hackathon.
